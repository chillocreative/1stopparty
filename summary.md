Before: [🖊️ Edit] [👁️ View] [⬇️ Download] [🗑️ Delete]
After:  [🖊️] [👁️] [⬇️] [🗑️]

Implementation:
- Removed text labels from all action buttons
- Added tooltips (title attributes) for accessibility
- Consistent padding (p-2) for uniform button sizing
- Maintained color coding: Blue (view/edit), Green (download), Red (delete)
- Enhanced space efficiency in Actions column
```

**3. Authentication System Fixes**
```php
Root Cause: API routes in api.php don't handle Laravel web sessions properly

Solution: Moved meeting-categories routes from api.php to web.php
Before (api.php):
Route::apiResource('meeting-categories', MeetingCategoryController::class)
    ->middleware(['web', 'auth']);

After (web.php):
Route::middleware(['web', 'auth'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/api/meeting-categories', [...]);
    Route::post('/api/meeting-categories', [...])->middleware('role:Admin');
    // ... other CRUD routes with proper middleware
});
```

**4. Frontend Authentication Updates**
```javascript
Updated credentials in 3 components:
- ViewAllMeetingCategories.jsx
- CreateMeeting.jsx  
- EditMeeting.jsx

Changed from: credentials: 'same-origin'
Changed to:   credentials: 'include'

This ensures proper session cookie handling for authentication.
```

#### **Key Features Enhanced**

- **View Button**: Blue eye icon with "View file" tooltip  
- **Download Button**: Green download icon with conditional tooltips
- **Delete Button**: Red trash icon with "Delete meeting" tooltip
- **Disabled States**: Proper gray styling for unavailable actions

**Authentication Architecture Fix**
- **Route Migration**: Moved from API routes to web routes for session handling
- **Session Compatibility**: Fixed Laravel web session authentication
- **Controller Optimization**: Removed redundant constructor middleware
- **Consistent Pattern**: Same approach as other successful pages (Users, Roles)

#### **Technical Implementation**

**Database Integration**

- Sorting logic enhanced for category field
- Search filter updated to include category names
- Default categories available from previous session

**Frontend Architecture**
- React state management for sorting and filtering
- Fetch API with proper credential handling
- Responsive table design with new column
- Tooltip system for accessibility

**Backend Optimizations**
- Route-level middleware instead of controller constructor
- Proper web session handling
- Enhanced error logging and debugging

- resources/js/pages/ViewAllMeetingCategories.jsx (credentials fix)
- resources/js/pages/CreateMeeting.jsx (credentials fix)
- resources/js/pages/EditMeeting.jsx (credentials fix)

Backend Updates:  
- routes/api.php (removed meeting-categories routes)
- routes/web.php (added proper web routes for categories)
- app/Http/Controllers/MeetingCategoryController.php (removed constructor middleware)

Database:
- Migration and seeding already completed from previous session
```

- **Error Elimination**: No more "Error loading categories" messages
- **Proper Security**: Role-based access maintained with web sessions
- **Session Persistence**: Login state properly maintained across app

#### **API Architecture Learning**

**Key Insight**: Route location affects authentication handling
- **API Routes (api.php)**: Designed for stateless token authentication
- **Web Routes (web.php)**: Designed for session-based authentication
- **Hybrid Approach**: API endpoints in web.php get best of both worlds

**Authentication Flow**:
1. User logs in → Laravel creates web session
2. Frontend makes request with `credentials: 'include'`
3. Web route receives request with session cookies
4. Middleware validates session authentication
5. Controller processes with authenticated user context

#### **Session Outcome**
✅ **Successfully enhanced Meetings List interface**
- Added sortable Category column with badge styling
